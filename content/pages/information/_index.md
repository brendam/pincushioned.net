pincushioned is the invention/fabrication of 2 original/derivative punk prog-rockers: Barry Moon (Baz) and Doug Nottingham (Dug).

Since 2007 they have been working from a remote/suburban desert bunker melding digital sounds and images with their analog counterparts- beating drums, destroying guitars, spinning dials, sliding faders, writing software, building instruments and projecting bizarre imagery. These garbage-pickers of music and art exploit anything/everything: Jay Z, Xenakis or Rembrandt are no safer than Shostakovich, the Butthole Surfers or Bill Viola from their synthesizing/thieving hands.

They go beyond post-modernism and into pre"whatever", creating an abstract body of interactive millennial media art. Their ethos/nihilism is evidenced by a DIY/DUI search for “digital answers for unasked questions” or “D.A.F.U.Q”. They play/labor laying down grooves/non-grooves in 4/4, 13/4, 17/5, etc. not to be clever (they are not), but because they feel it; they want you to feel it.

Note: If you don't feel it, please leave a comment with the pincushioned Complaints Department. As non-linear artists they will happily address/ignore criticisms before you make them.

When pincushioned are not self-indulgently crafting what Frank Zappa would characterize as “inconsequential poot,” Baz and Dug are employed/underwritten by various Arizona governments enriching/poisoning the minds of emerging/retreating artists. As you enjoy/hate their "presentation", keep in mind that Arizona’s #1 export is embarrassment.
