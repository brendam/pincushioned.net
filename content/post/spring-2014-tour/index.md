We will be touring the US in Spring 2014. Pincushioned will be performing and we will be giving concerts of percussion and live electronics, masterclasses in percussion and workshops in Max/MSP.

We will tour the West Coast in February, South in March, and Northeast/Midwest in April. If you are interested in having us perform at your venue/school or present masterclasses/workshops, or would like to be on a mailing list giving details of events, please email bazworkshopsAATgmail.com (replace AAT with @).

We have all our own gear (PA, projector, etc.) so can play any venue where you can supply electricity. We perform for free. A nominal fee may be applied for participants in Baz's Max/MSP workshops, but maybe it would be nicer to take donations for gas money :-)
